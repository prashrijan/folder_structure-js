# File & Folder Structure Using JavaScript

This project demonstrates how to dynamically create and display a file and folder structure using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The folder structure is represented by buttons that can be expanded or collapsed to show nested sub-folders, all styled with custom CSS.

## Features

- Dynamically generated file and folder structure using JavaScript.
- Expandable and collapsible folders.
- Responsive design to fit any screen size.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling the elements to make them visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Logic to dynamically create file and folder structures and handle the toggling (expand/collapse) behavior.

## File Structure

```
.
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── script.js
```

- **index.html**: The main HTML file where the structure will be displayed.
- **styles.css**: CSS file that contains all the styling for the file and folder elements.
- **script.js**: JavaScript file that contains the logic to create the file and folder structure dynamically and handle folder toggling.

   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
   You can open the `index.html` file in any browser of your choice to view the project.
